<h1>Some of my favourite Games</h1>
<h2>Mostly RPGs</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim</h3>
<img src="./assets/images/skyrim png1.png" />
<p>This is probably my most played game. I love the fantasy elements of the game and timeline and lore are very deep.</p>
<h3>Fallout 4</h3>
<p>Really cool post apocolyse RPG, with a Retro sci/fi vibe.</p>
<h3>Metal Gear Solid</h3>
<p>"Tactical Espionage Action" As is in the title. You are an expert infiltrator.
    Your mission is to gather Intel on the terrorist group "Foxhound" who have taken control of a top secret
    Military R&D facility, and are demanding a ransom or they will launch a Nuke.
    Weapons and Equipment OSP (on site procurement).
